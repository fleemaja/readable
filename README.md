# Readable

Readable is a content and comment web app made with React and Redux. As a learning exercise, all state management (even toggles and form inputs) is done through Redux.

Install all dependencies with ```npm install```, and then run ```npm start``` to launch a server at port 5001 and to open a localhost window of the running app at ```localhost:3000```.
