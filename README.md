# Readable

Readable is a content and comment web app made with React and Redux. As a learning exercise, all state management (even toggles and form inputs) is done through Redux.

Install all dependencies with ```npm install```, and then run ```npm start``` to launch a server at port 5001 and to open a localhost window of the running app at ```localhost:3000```.

The back end API code is found in the ```server``` folder and is taken from [Udacity's Readable starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter). Instructions for using the API can be found in the README of that project.
