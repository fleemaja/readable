# Readable

Readable is a content and comment web app made with React and Redux. As a learning exercise, all state management (even toggles and settings) is done through Redux.

The app depends on the api endpoints of Udacity's readable starter project (found here: ```https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter```).

To use the app first download the readable starter project (which provides server endpoints) and then install packages with ```npm install```, launch the server with ```node server```, and, unless modified in config.js, the server will use port 5001.

Once a server is running, open this project and install all frontend project dependencies with ```npm install```, and then run ```npm start``` to be able to open a localhost window of the running app at ```localhost:3000```.
